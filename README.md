### Raspberry Shake seismograph - Detection Statistics

Using the waveform data recorded by a Raspberry Shake seismograph (single station), earthquake events were classified as either detected or not detected. With these detection statistics, a logistic regression is fit to determine the empirical sensitivity of the seismograph. The results were then compared to the manufacturer's specifications.

### Dataset

The dataset included events for: global earthquake above about a magnitude Mw 6, regional earthquakes above about M4, and local earthquake down to about M 1. For each event, the section of the waveform corresponding to the P-wave arrival was viewed and the event recorded as either a detection or non-detection.
